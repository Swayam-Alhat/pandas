# Pandas

Pandas is a python library used for data manipulation and data analysis. It has two core data structures.

1. Dataframes - A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values and more) in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table or the data.frame in R. The columns are labeled with any string value whereas rows are labeled with index. (integer starts from 0).

2. Series - Each column in a DataFrame is a Series.

### Important notes

`info()` - It provides technical information of dataframes. **It also provides approx amount of RAM consumed by data frame**.
